          Sunita (Suni) L. Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998
          and is a veteran of three space missions, Expeditions 14/15, 32/33 and
          71/72. NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore launched aboard
          Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5, 2024, for its first crewed
          flight, arriving at the International Space Station on June 6.
          Following the agency’s decision to return Starliner uncrewed, the duo
          became Expedition 71/72 crewmembers and returned home in March 2025
          aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague
          and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov on NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9
          mission. Williams has completed 62 hours and 6 minutes of total
          spacewalk time over the course of her career, the most of any female
          astronaut, and fourth on NASA’s all-time list. Williams has logged 608
          days in space over her three flights.
